All credits to NylonCalculus. This is simply the code from the tutorial on http://nyloncalculus.com/2015/09/07/nylon-calculus-101-data-scraping-with-python/

This simple python program scrapes NBA player data from 1966 to 2015, including player names and a bunch of other stats. The data is collected from basketball-reference.com and is stored into a .csv file as seen in this repository.
