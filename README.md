All credits to NylonCalculus. This is simply the code from the tutorials on NylonCalculus: http://nyloncalculus.com/2015/09/07/nylon-calculus-101-data-scraping-with-python/

The NylonCalculus101 file is a simple python program that scrapes NBA player data (using Beautiful Soup) from 1966 to 2015, including player names and a bunch of other stats. The data is collected from basketball-reference.com and is stored into a .csv file as seen in this repository.

The second tutorial, named NylonCalculus102 uses seaborn and matplotlib to plot the acquired data.
